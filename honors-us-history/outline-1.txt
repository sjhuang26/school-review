## Geography

Atlantic and Pacific Oceans most influenced
	US neutrality
Appalachian Mountains
	Americans on one side, Indians on the other. A good example of a physical boundary that is hard to cross, but people cross it anyway. The British government made crossing this line illegal in the Proclamation of 1763.
Early colonial settlements were similar in that
	each developed near the coast line. EX) Jamestown (1607) Plymouth (1620) New Amsterdam (1625)
New England colonies were influenced by [PLUS]
	natural harbors contributing to the development of commerce, abundant forests
[MINUS]
	(agricultural!) rocky soil, short growing season
Geographic factors influenced the economy of New England by promoting
	a trade and manufacturing based industry (+fishing, +forestry)
Southern Colonies- [PLUS]
	fertile land and a long growing season
The South exported agricultural products to the
	North and in Europe.
Developed
	plantations (i.e., large farms that used slave labor).
Great Plains
	The relatively flat ... region of the U.S. between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, known for grain crops (aka food).

• Triangular Trade
	increased importation of enslaved Africans to the Western Hemisphere
• British Mercantilism
	The British purchased the raw materials and sold the products back to the colonies. They used legislation to prevent colonists from circumventing such "middleman" systems, severely limiting American trade.
• Salutary Neglect, and how it relates to British Mercantilism
	For a long time, Britain gave de facto freedom to colonial trade practices (they say it's illegal but they don't enforce it!); after the French and Indian War, the British returned to a traditional mercantilism, because of the severe Britain war debt.
• general information about French and Indian War
	The two sides were British + colonies vs. Indians + French. Disputed land in the Ohio River valley.
early attempts at democracy:
	Virginia House of Burgesses, Mayflower Compact, Town Hall Meetings
Albany Plan of Union
	the (failed!) "Join or Die" attempt to centralize the colonial government as a united set of colonies (but still under the British!)

## Independence Movement/Revolutionary War (American Revolution)

The Declaration of Independence described
	colonial grievances against British rule.
The writer and their influences
	Thomas Jefferson, influenced by John Locke's social contract theory about how humans have natural rights, including the right to overthrow any government that doesn't respect the rights.
Why similar to the Bill of Rights?
	Both help protect individual liberty
taxation without representation
	The idea that the British taxing the Americans is unfair because American colonists are not represented in the British government.
Thomas Paine-
	Wrote a book entitled Common Sense, which supported the Revolutionary War and was super persuasive
Sugar and Stamp Acts-
	taxes imported molasses and many kinds of printed material
Quartering Act-
	requires colonists to house and feed British soldiers
Townshend Acts-
	taxes various imported goods, including tea.
Boston Massacre-
	five people killed by British soldiers.

Committees of Correspondence?

Non-importation Agreements?

Boston Tea Party?

First Continental Congress?

Why did the Americans win the Revolutionary War?
	familiar land, France foreign aid

## Articles of Confederation

• Why was this popular?
	Americans had a bad experience with Britain's central strong government so they opted for a weak central government
[MINUS]
	Because states were so overpowered (e.g., full control of interstate and foreign commerce; taxes), there was virtually no way for the federal government to fund an army (taxes) or enforce national laws.
[PLUS]
	The Articles of Confederation set out a good plan for northwestern territories to be admitted as states (e.g., the 60,000 person rule).

## Constitutional Convention

Partial sources

- http://www.government-and-constitution.org/us-constitution/slave-trade-compromise.htm

Constitutional Convention-
	an urgent meeting to figure out a new Constitution to supersede the Articles of Confederation
• Shays’ Rebellion (1786)- Significant because it
	exposed the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation
Great Compromise
	the introduction of a bicameral legislature {i.e., states like New Jersey wanted equal representation per state in Congress; states like Virginia wanted representation based on population; the result was that one house would be based on population (House of Representatives) and the other house would have equal representation for all states (Senate)}
• Three-Fifths Compromise- 
	counting slaves as three-fifths of a person (vs. a whole person) for federal representation weakened House of Representatives influence of slave states 
• Other Major Compromises [LIST 2]- 
	Slave Trade (Congress could not prohibit the slave trade until 1808, but that any imported slaves could be taxed.)
	Election of President (use of electors)

Similarities between Constitution and Articles of Confederation [LIST 2]
	Both had a national legislature {i.e., lawmaking body}.
	Both had some way for states to cooperate.

Definition of Federalists
	Supporters of Constitution ratification
The Federalists published the
	 Federalist Papers
The Anti-Federalists agreed to ratify only after the compromise of adding 
	the Bill of Rights.

Bill of Rights, Unreasonable Search and Seizure- 
	...This amendment was put in because the British government used writs of assistance against American merchants during the colonial/Revolutionary War era.

John Peter Zenger
	key example of free speech -- a newspaper writer accused of libel {i.e., public criticism} against the New York governor was acquitted in a landmark court case because the facts he published were true

## Constitution: Basic Principles

Baron de Montesquieu
	checks and balances; three branches of government
The most essential feature of a democracy is
	free and open elections
definition of a Republican Government
	the people elect representatives who serve them in government

Fully explain Federalism [LIST 4]
	Federalism is a way to divide powers between federal and state.
	Reserved Powers were only for the states. e.g., public education
	Concurrent Powers were split between the two. e.g., taxation
	Delegated Powers were only for the federal government. e.g, interstate commerce, war

## Structure of the Federal Government

Fully explain Presidential roles [LIST 4]
	"Chief Legislator": uses the Cabinet to encourage key legislation to pass
	"Chief Executive": Commander-in-chief of the armed forces
	"Chief Diplomat": meets with foreign officials
	State of the Union: an annual speech about the general condition of the nation

Marbury v. Madison
	judicial review
What is a veto?
What is impeachment?
Elastic clause
	Congress can pass legislation to meet its "necessary and proper" duties as listed in the constitution
Admission to the Union Clause
	Congress is given power to admit new states to the Union

Examples of Unwritten Constitution [LIST 2]
	presidential cabinet
	political parties

## George Washington

Whiskey Rebellion
	The rebellion {i.e., violent protesting} of a group of Western Pennsylvania farmers (making a living off of whiskey -- remote location made shipping heavier goods like grain unaffordable) who disputed the whiskey tax. But the federal government sent in troops to stop it very quickly. This was the first instance of the federal government really enforcing its new laws.

why neutrality?
	The US needed to economically and militarily develop before participating in major European wars/alliances

Examples of neutrality [LIST 3]
	Farewell Address
	Proclamation of Neutrality: said that the US would be neutral between Britain and France
	French Revolutionary Wars
