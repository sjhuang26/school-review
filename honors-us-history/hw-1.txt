Pages 1126  to 1147

1.     To what did the American retreat from responsibility in foreign affairs aid in the rise of dictators in the 1930s?
	Appeasement
	due to the Great Depression, isolationism dominated
2.     Describe the factors that led to increased conflict in Europe
	emergence of Fascism (a mix of nationalism and socialism), first by Mussolini (seizing power in Italy), then by Hitler
	Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations
	Germany reoccupied the Rhineland with armed forces, violating the Versailles Treaty -- no one did anything
3.     Describe the factors that led to increased conflict in Asia
	Japanese invasion of Manchuria
	Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations
 
4.     Explain the relationship with the following PEDLIGS and the developing concept of American Neutrality and intervention;
 
a.    Kellogg - Briand Pact
	A fanciful and not very useful pact that outlawed war while not requiring any military intervention
b.    Washington Naval Conference
	Worked for a while.
c.    Nye Committee
	suggested a scandal where the armaments industry tricked America into entering WW1, this was not substantiated, but it reinforced American neutrality
d.    Arsenal for Democracy
	the lend-lease act (giving military aid for free to the allies) gradually increased in scope, in favor of non-neutrality

5.  To what extent could the United States have prevented the outbreak of WW II?
	The US could have advocated for stronger versions of particular treaties.
	The Four Power Treaty had no clause for military enforcement.
	The Nine-Power Treaty that endorsed the Open Door also had no such clause.
	The naval disarmament treaty did not regulate smaller craft (e.g., submarines).
	This gave President Harding a false confidence in world peace.
	A similar thing happened in the Kellogg-Briand Pact.
	When all the agreements were put to the test in Japan's invasion of Manchuria, the US did not respond with military aid to China.
6.     Considering the reasons for conflict in Asia, how surprising was the attack on Pearl Harbor - was the war between the United States and Japan inevitable?
	Japan was unwilling to withdraw from its variety of overseas expansions (China, French Indochina, Manchuria, etc.) and was unable to reach a compromis ewith the US.

2.     Describe some of the early setbacks experienced by the Allies at the start of the war
	Japan's "Rising Sun" empire and aggressive military expansion results in the loss of Guam, Wake Islands, Gilbert Islands, Hong Kong, Burma -- Battle of Midway was turnaround
	loss of 400 ships due to German submarine warfare -- eventually, effective countermeasures such as small escort vessels
3.    Identify the various economic controls FDR took to ready the U.S. for war.
	War Production Board -- set extremely high production goals for factories to follow
	encouraged civilians to conserve clothing, scrap metal, and victory gardens, tire and gasoline rationing

Casablanca Conference
	after the victory in North Africa
	decided to delay a major assault on France, instead focusing on Sicily and Italy
	decided that only "unconditional surrender" of the whole enemy Axis would end the war -- reducing Soviet suspicion -- this decision would require Russian armies to chase German forces all the way back to Germany, which influenced geographic spread of communism

	war against Japan would continue until unconditional surrender
	Japan will have to give territory back to China
	Japan will have to give up the pacific islands they took after 1941

## “World War Two” – 1944 to 1945

Pages: 1176 to 1197

1.     To what extent did the economic power of the U.S. help it to win World War Two?
	The US had a strong navy (able to recover from Pearl Harbor), strong defense manufacturing (able to supply enough tanks and amphibious vehicles for D-Day), and strong air force (able to bomb Japan mainland and perform island hopping).

2.     Describe the cause and effect of “Operation Overlord” (D-Day)
	Cause: after deciding on invading France, the Allied planners use tons of military force to penetrate the Atlantic Wall, fortifications and minefields that the Germans set up

3.     Identify the factors that led to the United States having the advantage in the war in the Pacific.
	leapfrogging -- jumping from island to island to take military control
	Marshall Islands + Mariana Islands takeover -- close enough to Japan mainland for bombers to reach it
	Battle of Layte Gulf (Phillipines) -- major naval battle that damaged Japan naval power

4.     Explain the events and discussion at the Yalta Conference - to what extent did FDR “sell out” the Allies?
	the Soviets had a large advantage of negotiation in these matters due to geography

	the US lost many lives but its homeland was undamaged (compared to, say, Europe)
	ended Great Depression
	new electronics: radar, computers
	new materials: plastics, synthetics
	new industrial tech: atomic energy, rockets, jet engines
	benefit to minority rights movements
	isolationism is tossed aside
