## Geography

Atlantic and Pacific Oceans most influenced 			U.S. foreign policy throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th century.
Oceans on the east & west coasts helped the U.S. 			maintain its foreign policy of neutrality during much of the
1800s.
Appalachian Mountains 			served as [a natural barrier] for British colonial settlements prior to the Revolutionary War.
Proclamation Line of 1763- 			... in order to avoid conflicts between American colonists and Native Americans.
Early colonial settlements were similar in that 			each developed near the coast line. EX) Jamestown (1607) Plymouth (1620) New Amsterdam (1625)
New England colonies were influenced by [PLUS]			natural harbors contributing to the development of commerce, abundant forests,
[MINUS]			rocky soil, short growing season
Geographic factors influenced the economy of New England by promoting 			the growth of trade, manufacturing, and commercial fishing
Southern Colonies- [PLUS]			fertile land and a long growing season
agricultural products processed in the 			North and in Europe.
Developed 			plantations (large farms that used slave labor).
Great Plains 			The relatively flat ... region of the U.S. between the Mississippi River and the Rocky
Mountains, known for grain crops (aka food).

• Triangular Trade			increased importation of enslaved Africans to the Western Hemisphere
• British Mercantilism			...British buy raw materials from the colonies and sell them finished products; Limited manufacturing and trade
• Salutary Neglect- 			Led to the development of independent colonial trade practices. {QUOTE Salutary neglect was an unofficial British policy of non-enforcement of trade regulations on their American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. The purpose was to maximize economic output amongst the colonists while maintain some form of control.}
• French and Indian War-			 Caused by disputed land claims in the Ohio River valley between the French and the British (the French and Indians were on the same side); Britain war debt => taxing the colonies => end of salutary neglect
early attempts at democracy:			Virginia House of Burgesses, Mayflower Compact, Town Hall Meetings
Albany Plan of Union:			the first real attempt (failed) to unify the colonies under a central government while remaining under the rule of Britain

## Independence Movement/Revolutionary War (American Revolution)

The Declaration of Independence described			colonial grievances against British rule.
Written by			Thomas Jefferson, who was inspired by the ideas of John Locke regarding the natural rights of the people. The government exists solely to protect the natural rights (otherwise, overthrow is justified). This is social contract theory.
Why similar to the Bill of Rights?			Limits on gov't power; prioritizes individual liberty
taxation without representation			Many people thought that the taxes were unjust because the colonists had no representation in British government
Thomas Paine-			Published Common Sense (very persuasive)
Sugar and Stamp Acts-			tax foreign molasses and printed material.
Quartering Act-			requires colonists to house and feed British soldiers.
Townshend Acts-			taxes imported goods and tea.
Boston Massacre-			five people killed by British soldiers.

Committees of Correspondence?

Non-importation Agreements?

Boston Tea Party?

First Continental Congress?

Why did the Americans win the Revolutionary War?			familiar land, France foreign aid

## Articles of Confederation

• Why was this popular?			Americans distrusted central strong government due to bad experiences with Britain
[MINUS]			states had virtually all the power, which was problematic (army support) (lack of federal law enforcement)
[PLUS]			It provided a system for governing the Western territories and eventually admit them to the Union as new states.
States had the power to 			tax, print money, and control trade

## Constitutional Convention

Goal?			correct the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation
• Shays’ Rebellion (1786)- Significant because it			Exposed the need for a stronger national government
Great Compromise			states like New Jersey wanted equal representation per state in Congress; states like Virginia wanted representation based on population; the result was that one house would be based on population (House of Representatives) and the other house would have equal representation for all states (Senate).
• Three-Fifths Compromise- 			States with high slave populations wanted high representation in the House of Representatives; in the end, slaves were counted as 3/5 a person for representation purposes
• Other Major Compromises- 			Slave Trade, Election of President.
