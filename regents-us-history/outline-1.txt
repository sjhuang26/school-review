## Geography

Atlantic and Pacific Oceans most influenced 			anything related to US neutrality
Appalachian Mountains 			Very hard to cross for early colonists, but some were eventually motivated to cross, resulting in the Proclamation Line of 1763, which the British government basically made this illegal (to avoid Indian conflicts)
Early colonial settlements were similar in that 			each developed near the coast line. EX) Jamestown (1607) Plymouth (1620) New Amsterdam (1625)
New England colonies were influenced by [PLUS]			natural harbors contributing to the development of commerce, abundant forests
[MINUS]			(agricultural!) rocky soil, short growing season
Geographic factors influenced the economy of New England by promoting 			a trade and manufacturing based industry (+fishing, +forestry)
Southern Colonies- [PLUS]			fertile land and a long growing season
The South exported agricultural products to the 			North and in Europe.
Developed 			plantations (i.e., large farms that used slave labor).
Great Plains 			The relatively flat ... region of the U.S. between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, known for grain crops (aka food).

• Triangular Trade			increased importation of enslaved Africans to the Western Hemisphere
• British Mercantilism			The British purchased the raw materials and sold the products back to the colonies. They used legislation to prevent colonists from circumventing such "middleman" systems, severely limiting American trade.
• Salutary Neglect- 			Britain gives significant freedom to colonial trade practices, often de facto (they say it's illegal but they don't enforce it!); French and Indian War => Britain war debt => taxing the colonies => end of salutary neglect.
• French and Indian War-			The two sides were British + colonies vs. Indians + French. Disputed land in the Ohio River valley.
early attempts at democracy:			Virginia House of Burgesses, Mayflower Compact, Town Hall Meetings
Albany Plan of Union			the (failed!) "Join or Die" attempt to centralize the colonial government as a united set of colonies (but still under the British!)

## Independence Movement/Revolutionary War (American Revolution)

The Declaration of Independence described			colonial grievances against British rule.
The writer and their influences			Thomas Jefferson, who strongly supported John Locke's ideas about human freedom. Humans have natural rights and can overthrow any government that doesn't respect them. This is social contract theory.
Why similar to the Bill of Rights?			Both provide a protection of individual liberty
taxation without representation			The idea that the British taxing the Americans is unfair because in the British government, there is no representation of American colonists.
Thomas Paine-			Published Common Sense (very persuasive)
Sugar and Stamp Acts-			tax foreign molasses and printed material.
Quartering Act-			requires colonists to house and feed British soldiers.
Townshend Acts-			taxes imported goods and tea.
Boston Massacre-			five people killed by British soldiers.

Committees of Correspondence?

Non-importation Agreements?

Boston Tea Party?

First Continental Congress?

Why did the Americans win the Revolutionary War?			familiar land, France foreign aid

## Articles of Confederation

• Why was this popular?			Americans distrusted central strong government due to bad experiences with Britain
[MINUS]			Because states were so overpowered (e.g., full control of interstate and foreign commerce; taxes), there was no way for the federal government to fund an army (taxes) or enforce national laws.
[PLUS]			The Articles of Confederation set out a good plan for northwestern territories to be admitted as states (e.g., the 60,000 person rule).

## Constitutional Convention

Constitutional Convention-			an urgent meeting to figure out a new Constitution to supersede the Articles of Confederation
• Shays’ Rebellion (1786)- Significant because it			Exposed the need for a stronger national government
Great Compromise			the introduction of a bicameral legislature {i.e., states like New Jersey wanted equal representation per state in Congress; states like Virginia wanted representation based on population; the result was that one house would be based on population (House of Representatives) and the other house would have equal representation for all states (Senate)}
• Three-Fifths Compromise- 			three-fifths representation for slaves: the main controversy was that counting a slave as a full person would give certain slave states oversized representation in the House of Representatives; in the end, slaves were counted as 3/5 a person
• Other Major Compromises- 			Slave Trade, Election of President.

Similarities between Constitution and Articles of Confederation [LIST 2]

Both provided a national legislature (lawmaking body).
Both provided a way for states to cooperate.

The Federalists published the			 Federalist Papers which encouraged ratification of the Constitution. 
The Anti-Federalists agreed to ratify only after the compromise of adding 			the Bill of Rights to the Constitution.

Bill of Rights, Unreasonable Search and Seizure- 			...This amendment was put in because the British government used writs of assistance against American merchants during the colonial/Revolutionary War era.

John Peter Zenger			The governor of New York arrested him for publishing criticism about him, but Zenger was acquitted because the facts he published were true (free speech)

## Constitution: Basic Principles

Baron de Montesquieu		checks and balances; three branches of government
The most essential feature of a democracy is			free and open elections
Republican Government		the people elect representatives who serve them in government

Fully explain Federalism [LIST 4]

Federalism is a way to divide powers between federal and state.
Reserved Powers were only for the states. e.g., public education
Concurrent Powers were split between the two. e.g., taxation
Delegated Powers were only for the federal government. e.g, interstate commerce, war

## Structure of the Federal Government

Fully explain Presidential roles [LIST 4]

"Chief Legislator": uses the Cabinet to encourage key legislation to pass
"Chief Executive": Commander-in-chief of the armed forces
"Chief Diplomat": meets with foreign officials
State of the Union: an annual speech about the general condition of the nation

Marbury v. Madison			judicial review
What is a veto?
What is impeachment?
Elastic clause			Congress can pass legislation to meet its "necessary and proper" duties as listed in the constitution

Examples of Unwritten Constitution [LIST 2]

presidential cabinet
political parties

## George Washington

Whiskey Rebellion			A group of Western Pennsylvania farmers who disputed the whiskey tax (their livelihood was growing whiskey, probably because their remote location made shipping heavier goods like grain unaffordable). They ended up military revolting but the federal government sent in troops to stop it very quickly. This was the first instance of the federal government really enforcing its new laws.

why neutrality?			The US needed to economically and militarily develop before participating in major European wars/alliances

Examples of neutrality [LIST 2]

Farewell Address
Proclamation of Neutrality			said that the US would be neutral between Britain and France
